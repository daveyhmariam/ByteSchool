Your code demonstrates a good design in many respects, but there are areas that could benefit from improvements. Here's a breakdown of the design and possible enhancements:

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - **Good**: You have a clear separation between different components like `Task`, `Project`, `Checker`, and `CodeChecker`, which helps in organizing the code.
   - **Improvement**: In `Task` and `Project`, there is some overlap between the creation of checkers and task management. Consider using a **factory pattern** to handle the creation of checkers or tasks so that the logic of creation is decoupled from the logic of managing them.

### 2. **Encapsulation**
   - **Good**: The use of properties (e.g., `score_mandatory`, `task_score`) hides the internal details of the class and exposes a clean API for interacting with objects.
   - **Improvement**: For the internal methods like `update_checkes_complete` and `update_task_score`, consider naming them more descriptively (e.g., `calculate_check_completion`, `calculate_task_score`). This will make it clear that these methods compute values rather than just updating state.

### 3. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - **Good**: Each class (`Task`, `Project`, `Checker`, `CodeChecker`) seems to have a defined responsibility. 
   - **Improvement**: The `Task` class appears to handle both task management and checker creation. Consider delegating checker creation to a **dedicated checker factory** or external manager, allowing `Task` to focus solely on task-related logic.

### 4. **Error Handling**
   - **Good**: You have error handling for subprocess calls and zero division in the code.
   - **Improvement**: Instead of just catching `FileNotFoundError` and `CalledProcessError` and printing them, you could log these errors or raise custom exceptions to provide more meaningful error feedback and maintain clarity in error reporting.

### 5. **Dependency Injection**
   - **Improvement**: When creating tasks and checkers, consider using **dependency injection** (passing external dependencies like repository URLs or commands as arguments) rather than hardcoding certain values (e.g., `repo_url=''` and `clone_dir='repo'`).

### 6. **Use of Collections**
   - **Good**: You make good use of dictionaries (`_checkers_mandatory`, `_checkers`) for organizing and retrieving checkers efficiently.
   - **Improvement**: You might want to explore using more advanced data structures or patterns, such as **composite patterns**, to handle different types of checkers more uniformly, especially if you plan to extend the system with more checker types.

### 7. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Good**: The use of unit tests is a good practice to ensure the integrity of your code.
   - **Improvement**: You could further improve the design by adding **input validation** for parameters when creating checkers and tasks (e.g., ensuring non-empty `file_name`, valid `weight` values, etc.).

### 8. **Reusability**
   - **Good**: The modular design of the classes suggests a focus on reusability. Each component can be used and tested independently.
   - **Improvement**: You could extract some logic (e.g., in `update_scores_each` or `start_checking`) into smaller methods to improve reusability and readability, especially if you foresee needing similar functionality elsewhere.

### 9. **Maintainability and Scalability**
   - **Good**: The modular design of the project and tasks allows for future extensibility. You can add more types of checkers or more attributes to tasks without significant refactoring.
   - **Improvement**: Consider documenting the methods more thoroughly, especially those that handle subprocesses or complex business logic. This would improve the long-term maintainability of the code.

### 10. **Object-Oriented Design Principles**
   - **Good**: The use of inheritance (e.g., `CodeChecker` inheriting from `Checker`) is a sound application of OOP principles.
   - **Improvement**: Ensure that **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** is adhered to in the inheritance. Each subclass (e.g., `CodeChecker`) should fully adhere to the contract of its parent class (`Checker`) and not break functionality.

### Suggested Refactoring:
- **Factory Pattern** for creating tasks or checkers to encapsulate object creation.
- **Strategy Pattern** for defining different types of checkers and their behaviors (mandatory, optional, etc.).
- Use **logging** for error handling instead of simple print statements to make debugging easier in larger systems.

### Final Thoughts:
Your code is generally well-structured and follows many solid design principles. However, with some refactoring (especially around separation of concerns, error handling, and task/checker creation), you can improve both the clarity and maintainability of the project.
